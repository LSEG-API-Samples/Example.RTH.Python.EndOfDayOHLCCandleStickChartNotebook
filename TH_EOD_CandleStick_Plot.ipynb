    "# Generate CandleStick chart using Tick History End of Day data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use python to request daily end of day data and generate basic graphs and CandleSticks chart for trading analysis. Basically, the [Japanese candlestick chart](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/) commonly used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time. It's popular in finance and some strategies in technical analysis use them to make trading decisions, depending on the shape, color, and position of the candles.\n",
    "\n",
    "[LSEG Tick History](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-tick-history/refinitiv-tick-history-rth-rest-api) is an Internet-hosted product on the DataScope Select platform that provides a REST API for unparalleled access to historical high-frequency data across global asset classes dating to 1996. Python developer can use On-demand request to retrieve End of Day data and then they can use the time series tools available in Python or Pandas to works with the data and generate the candlestick chart and calculate a moving average from the time series data. Note that this example will not cover technical analysis topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages Required\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses httpclient from Tornado web framework and python JSON library to manage an HTTP request and response message. We also need to use Pandas, Matplotlib and candlestick_ohlc from mpl_finance library to process and visualize the stock data returned from Tick Historical server. We also use a method distplot from seaborn package to plot a simple histogram to see a distribution of the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## Implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main steps in this example, starting from using the REST API retrieves the Time Series data and plotting graphs and generate a CandleStick Chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step1** Get Access Token from Tick Historical Server.\n",
    "* **Step2** Use the Access Token to send OnDemand Extraction request to retrieve the end of day data from the server. It will return data buffer containing raw data in CSV format. We need to use time-series tool such as Pandas to get the data and transform it into dataframe.\n",
    "* **Step3** Visualizing Stock Data by plotting the CandleStick chart from the dataframe and calculate the moving average from the data and plot it to CandleStick chart for technical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get Access Token from DSS Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the tutorial from [Tick History REST API tutorial]https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-tick-history/refinitiv-tick-history-rth-rest-api/tutorials), to get the access token, we have to send HTTP post message to below endpoint and it needs to send the DSS Username and Password in the request body. \n",

Please note that from details in this [link](https://matplotlib.org/api/finance_api.html), module matplotlib.finance is deprecated in 2.0 and has been moved to a module called mpl_finance. It's still working when we have matplotlib version 2.1.2 but this may stop working in any future releases, however, you still be able to use mpl_finance module to use this feature. Note that mpl_finance is no longer maintained.  \n",

And there are some additional steps to configuring a tick locating and formatting before plotting the graph. Hence we will add these steps to a new function instead so it can do formatting and generating a graph and then we can re-use this function to plot a moving average later.

MA is a widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the “noise” from random short-term price fluctuations. It is a trend-following or lagging, indicator because it is based on past prices. The two basic and commonly used moving averages are the simple moving average (SMA), which is the simple average of a security over a defined number of time periods, and the exponential moving average (EMA), which gives greater weight to more recent prices. Note that this example will use only SMA. The most common applications of moving averages are to identify the trend direction and to determine support and resistance levels. After we get the CandleStick chart, it's time to calculate Moving averages and plot to the CandleSticks graph.\n",
